    <p><h3><strong>Easy Peasy Dairy-Free Pesto Sauce</strong></h3></p>
    <p>This pesto sauce is simple, delicious, allergen-free, and super versatile! The recipe doesn't contain any dairy which is really common in most pesto recipes. It comes together in just a few minutes. Picking the basil off your stems is by far the most complicated task involved, and it's a sinch. I recommend trying to remember the lyrics to Brian McKnight's old school hit 'Back At One' while you do this.</p>
<p><h3>INGREDIENTS</h3></p>
<p><ul>
    <li>3/4c basil leaves</li>
    <li>3tbsp pine nuts</li>
    <li>3/4tsp lemon juice</li>
    <li>1/2tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic</li>
    <li>3tbsp extra virgin olive oil</li>
</ul></p>
<p><h3>STEPS</h3></p>
<p><ol>
    <li>Lightly toast the nuts in a skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes.</li>
    <li>Place all ingredients except for oil in a small food processor.</li>
    <li>Slowly incorporate the oil while the machine is running, until a smooth paste has formed. Continue blending for 15 seconds to thin the sauce out.</li>
    <li>Alternatively, crush all of the ingredients in a mortar and pestle and blend until smooth.</li></ol></p>
